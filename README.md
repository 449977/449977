Hi, I am @449977, although you cannot see me, I am very open to speak to people. I like programing because it gives me the freedom of creating whatever I want. 
I am looking for repos that are open for beginners, as I am one! Please contact me if needed at louis.449977@proton.me. I support FOSS and Open Source in general. 
I only know python and the bases for HTML and CSS, but I'm open to learning any other languages!
